This project involves developing a mobile application using React Native, and it consists of a shopping application.

CartScreen.js: This screen manages the content of the shopping cart and its functionalities. It lists the items in the cart and allows users to increase, decrease, or remove the quantity of each item.

BookScreen.js: The main screen where books are listed. It displays a list of books and allows users to add them to the cart.

ShoppingCartIcon.js: A component containing the shopping cart icon. It displays the number of items in the cart and directs users to the CartScreen.

redux: The application state is managed using Redux. Actions such as ADD_TO_CART, REMOVE_TO_CART, INCREASE_QUANTITY, and DECREASE_QUANTITY are used to update the cart's content and quantity.

react-navigation: Provides navigation functionality within the application, allowing navigation between the Books and Cart screens.

The project includes a main screen listing books and a shopping cart screen with the ability to add, increase/decrease quantity, and remove items from the cart. Redux is used to manage the application state, and react-navigation facilitates navigation between screens. Both screens have a user-friendly interface and display the total price of the cart.

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
